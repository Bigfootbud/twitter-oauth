This project takes advantage of Twitter's List functionality and allows us to use the API to create a widget that flips lists the other way around and create a friend box you can put in your sidebar that allows your visitors to fill in their twitter name and join a specially crafted friend list in your twitter account.

This version of the friend box connects to Twitter using twitteroauth library and returns JSON format as a regular array.
