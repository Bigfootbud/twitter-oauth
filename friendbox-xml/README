This project takes advantage of Twitter's List functionality and allows us
to use the Twitter API to create a widget that reverses the functionality
of a list, allowing your visitors to fill in their twitter name and join a 
specially crafted friend list in your twitter account.

This version of the friend box connects to Twitter using twitteroauth library 
and returns XML format just like the original project.
